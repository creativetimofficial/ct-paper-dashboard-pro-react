**[Paper Dashboard PRO React](https://demos.creative-tim.com/paper-dashboard-pro-react/#/admin/dashboard)** is a beautiful [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) ([Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/)) admin dashboard with a large number of components, designed to look neat and organized. If you are looking for a tool to manage and visualize data about your business, this dashboard is the thing for you. It combines colors that are easy on the eye, spacious cards, beautiful typography, and graphics. Paper Dashboard PRO React comes packed with all plugins that you might need inside a project and documentation on how to get started. It is light and easy to use, and also very powerful.


We made it our priority to not add things that you don't need, so the Paper Dashboard PRO React comes with just enough features for you to easily use. It combines multiple components and plugins and features numerous example of how it can be used. Inside the archive, you will also find multiple example pages to get you started or provide inspiration.


**[Paper Dashboard PRO React](https://demos.creative-tim.com/paper-dashboard-pro-react/#/admin/dashboard)** is the extended version of [Paper Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/paper-dashboard-pro). Based on feedback from people that downloaded and used it, we have added needed components, and we have created multiple examples pages. We are curious to see how you want to use it and also improve it, so let us know any feedback you have.



**Bootstrap 4 support**


Paper Dashboard PRO React is built on top of [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/) with the usage of [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/), so it fully supports it. Most of the elements from the dashboard are re-designed to resemble sheets of paper and color pastels. If they are elements that we have not touched, they will gracefully fall back to the [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/) / [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) default.


Let us know what you think and what we can improve below. And good luck with development!
